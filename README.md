3. **GitHub and Azure DevOps integration:** Changes to the repository trigger automated builds and deployments, streamlining the development process.
4. **Global distribution:** Content is distributed globally, ensuring optimal performance for users worldwide.
5. **Free SSL certificates:** SSL certificates are automatically provided and renewed, prioritizing security for users interacting with the lifestyle assistant.
